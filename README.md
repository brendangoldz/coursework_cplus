# C++ Weatherstation
C++ Coursework and Practice 
Objective of this course was to complete a C++ Weatherstation.
The objective of the project was to grasp a better understanding of OOP programming using the C++ language.

The project starts off in the first 3 projects as a simple in and out program where a user will enter data and the application will output it.

Towards project 4-6, the complexity of the programming increases as we are now allowing for user control, storing of data as well as error checking. We also start using pointers and structs at project 6.

The program evolves after project 7-10 with Struct objects, then using classes and using external functions to make the main function lighter. 

The end of the program goes into internationalization using pig latin where a user can select to have the pogram read in pig latin or english. Lastly, the weather station is structured for multi-instance stations, running weather stations with different languages within the application.
